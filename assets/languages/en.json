L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tant qu'il est plus agr\u00e9able pour tout le monde (exploitant, conducteur, voyageur...)\r\n            de savoir combien de cyclistes souhaitent voyager avec leur monture. Cela permet de pr\u00e9voir au mieux les\r\n            \u00e9ventuelles remorques \u00e0 atteler, ou d'annoncer aux voyageurs que le porte-v\u00e9los est d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien rempli.":"RESABIKE.CH is a project aimed at making life easier for cyclists traveling by public transport on the regional lines. We are therefore mainly talking about buses and other postbuses, and especially in the tourist regions! The idea is that it is more agreeable for everyone (operator, driver, traveler ...) to know how many cyclists wish to travel with their horses. This makes it possible to best anticipate the possible trailers to be hitched up, or to announce to the passengers that the carrier is already well filled.","die Postautochauffeure sind unglaublich nett und hilfsbereit, ich f\u00fchle mich als Biker im Val d\u2019Anniviers\r\n                sehr willkommen und das System mit dem Online Reservieren ist super !
